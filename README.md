### Greetings, FOSS friends!

I'm Dan, an open-source programmer interested in distributed systems, networking and instrumentation. I mostly write tools in Go and Rust for Linux systems, with the occasional bash script thrown in for good measure!

I currently help maintain the following projects:
- [oauth2-proxy](https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy) - A reverse proxy that provides authentication via external providers. 

You'll generally find me on the internet as `syscll`, and can read some of my software ramblings at https://syscll.org
